I am a current Computer Science student at the University of Northern BC. I am also married with a 4 year old son. I enjoy spending time with my family and playing whatever sport I can.

I also work part time at Sparkgeo as a Developer where I work on various customer projects. In particular I am fluent in Java and Python, with experience in designing, building, and deploying microservices.
